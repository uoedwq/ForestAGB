# Forest AGB estimation
Here we propose an approach for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, using a combination of remote sensing data. The scripts to process Envisat ASAR data are written in IDL, and the rest of remote sensing data, including ALOS PALSAR, Landsat-5 and DEM, are precessed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using JavaScript. The workflow of remote sensing data precession and forest AGB estimation is shown below.
